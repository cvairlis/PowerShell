Contacts v1.0 READ ME

Contacts Tool using: PowerShell.

Contacts Tool is a simple tool for your PC running Windows OS, including GUI.
Contacts Tool works with CSV files to parse your contacts and gives you the ability to search for contacts by requesting a random field from a contact.
Given the fact that every contact has a list of header fields, you can search for anything and if it will find something to match with your request it will return a grid view window with the contacts found.

WAY IT WORKS:
Contacts Tool looks at the folder that contain the running script (or executable) to find a CSV file. If there is not any CSV file it will inform you with a message, otherwise it will parse the CSV file (or more than one CSV files) and will load it to memory. After the CSV parsing you will be able to search for the contact you are interested about and all the information you need. More specifically it provides the following:
  - Graphical User Interface
  - Parsing from CSV file
  - Text fields and Search button for the Search function.
  - etc.

KEY POINTS:
GUI containts Greek characters.
Be careful with you CSV. If there are "new line characters" without finishing a contact, contacts will not be parsed succesfully!
